# Adapt & Critique

The website is really well-built, and several of the sections truly stand out for their attention to detail. However, I firmly beleive there are some aspects that could be improved. In my opininon, it just seems too simple on the home page. Everything is piled together. Although the cards are quite attractive and a unique touch, there is a ton of black space underneath them that may easily be filled with additional content. Coca-Cola will without a doubt be this company's rival. 

I observed the Coca-Cola website is much more straightforward as I was exploring it. Everything seemed to have been completed in a matter of minutes. It's like there was no effort at all. We all know that red is the colour of Coca-Cola. there isn't even a trace of red on the page, as opposed to Pepsi, which is blue and draws users in. It's already one step ahead. We may add the drawbacks from Coca-Cola's website to ours, but they will be pros/advantages. 

I already know what I want to acheive with mt stapi project; I have laid out the ideas, and practice has been quite helpful. Eveyrthing will fit in with this website whether it's a app or a page. Without a doubt, the website will be relevant to my strapi project.
